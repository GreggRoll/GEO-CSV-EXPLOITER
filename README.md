Dealing with NaN values and zeros
How I deal with NaN value is that I only remove the affected rows when the percentage of NaN within that column is less than 5%. This applies to both numerical and categorical values. For anything above 5%, I replace the NaN values with median. For categorical values, the NaN values will be replace by mode.

Dealing with zeros is much harder as it is challenging to differentiate between a zero that is meaningful (has a purpose and should not be removed) and a zero that serves no purpose and can potentially add more noise to the dataset. Hence, I decided to inform the user about the percentage of zeros in the dataset.

Processing outliers
I use Z-score to detect outliers. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data pointâ€™s score is identical to the mean score. A Z-score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean. Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean.

In most cases, a threshold of 3 or -3 is used to filter off outliers and I have used this approach for all of my analysis.

Correlation
For correlation, I included:

Pearson and Spearman correlation for numerical-numerical variables.
One Way ANOVA for numerical-categorical variables
Chi-Square test for categorical-categorical variables
Using itertools.combinations, I identify every possible combinations among numerical-numerical variables, numerical-categorical variables and categorical-categorical variables. I then apply the correlation test based on the criteria I have set above.

Plots
For plots, I created:

Scatterplot for numerical variables
Countplot for categorical variables
Boxplot for numerical-categorical variables
Similar to correlation, I used itertools.combinations to create every possible plot. I have also added the hue feature to each scatterplot. I will only do so when the categorical variable has less than 5 unique values. Example, if hue = "fruits", I should only see 4 types of fruits.

GEOSPATIAL
Upon obtaining sufficient feedback on this script, I will register this package in PyPI to streamline installation.
Instead of generating txt reports, I will utilise HTML and Bootstrap to generate a much more appeasing look.
package with py2exe so it can be used by non-python folk
